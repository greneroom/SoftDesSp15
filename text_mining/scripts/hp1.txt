DUMBLEDORE: I should have known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors
true, Albus?
DUMBLEDORE: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: And the boy?
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid is bringing him.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as
important as this?
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
HAGRID: Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall, ah.
DUMBLEDORE: No problems I trust, Hagrid?
HAGRID: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol.
Try not to wake `im. There yeh go.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Albus, do you really think it's safe leaving him with
these people? I've watched them all day. There're the worst sort of Muggles
imaginable! They really are-
DUMBLEDORE: ...the only family he has.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our
world who doesn't know his name.
DUMBLEDORE: Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that-
until he is ready.
HAGRID: (Sniff) Ah.
DUMBLEDORE: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. Good
luck, Harry Potter.

It's just- I've never talked to a snake before. Do you- only, do you talk to

learned it all?
HARRY: Learnt what?
HAGRID: You're a wizard, Harry.
HARRY: I- I'm a what?
HAGRID: A wizard. And a thumpin' good un, I'd wager, once you're trained up a
little.
HARRY: No, you've made a mistake. I mean, I... can't be a, a, a wizard... I
mean, I'm... just... Harry. Just Harry!
HAGRID: Well, "Just Harry", did you ever make anything happen? Anything you
couldn't explain, when you were angry... or, or scared? Um- hum.
DUDLEY: Oh, huh, huh...
HARRY: "Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been
accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
UNCLE VERNON: He will not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in
that we'd put a stop to all of this rubbish!
HARRY: You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
AUNT PETUNIA: Of course, we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister
being who she was? Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her
letter. `We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?' I was the only
one to see her for what she was- a freak! And then she met that Potter, and
then she had you, and I knew you would be the same, just as strange, just
as...abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.
HARRY: Blown up?! You told me my parents died in a car crash!
HAGRID: A car crash? A car crash kill Lily and James Potter?
AUNT PETUNIA: We had to say something.
HAGRID: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
UNCLE VERNON: He'll not be going.
HAGRID: Oh-ho, ho, and I suppose a great Muggle like yerself is gonna stop
`im.
HARRY: Muggle?
HAGRID: Non-magic folk. This boy's had `is name down since he were born. He's
goin' to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. And,
he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus
Dumbledore...
UNCLE VERNON: I will not pay to have some crack pot old fool teach him magic
tricks!

DUDLEY: Whoa!
AUNT PETUNIA: Ahh! Ahhh!
UNCLE VERNON: Ahh! No!
DUDLEY: Ahh! Ahhh! Get it off! Get it off!
HAGRID: Oh, uh- I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts abou'
that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.

rather stay, o' course. Hmm.

long.

HARRY: Hello? Hello?
MR. OLLIVANDER: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only
yesterday that you mother and father were in here buying their first wands.
Ah... here we are. Well, give it a wave. Apparently not! Perhaps...this? No,
no, definitely not. No matter. I wonder... Curious... very curious.
HARRY: S-sorry, but what's curious?
MR. OLLIVANDER: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so
happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand gave another
feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this
wand, when its brother gave you that scar.
HARRY: And who owned that wand?
MR. OLLIVANDER: We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr.
Potter. It's not always clear why. But, I think it is clear that we can
expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great
things. Terrible, yes. But great.

HARRY: He killed my parents didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know,
Hagrid. I know you do.
HAGRID: First, and understand this, Harry, because it's very important. Not
all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one
wizard that went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-. His name was V-.
HARRY: Well, maybe if you wrote it down?
HAGRID: Nah, I can't spell it. All right... Voldemort.

HAGRID: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like
that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.
HARRY: What happened to V-... to You-Know-Who?
HAGRID: Well, some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Nope, I reckon
he's out there still. Too tired to carry on. But one thing's absolutely
certain. Somethin' about you stumped him that night. That's why you're
famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're `The Boy Who Lived!'

Stick to it Harry, that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

MRS. WEASLEY: How to get onto the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's

yellow."

Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself. But they've all worked

But, where to put you...
HARRY: Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!
SORTING HAT: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know.
It's all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to
greatness, there's no doubt about that. No?

Slytherin.

it would be more useful if I transfigured Mr. Potter and yourself into a

and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few who
possess the predisposition... I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and
ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even
put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts
in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to
not pay attention. Mr. Potter... our new celebrity. Tell me, what would I get
if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't
know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you
to find me a bezoar?
HARRY: I- I don't know, sir.
SNAPE: And, what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?

work of Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while
acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken. The vault in question,

take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom

handle the Quaffle, and try to put it through one of those three hoops. The
Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far?
HARRY: I think so. What are those?
WOOD: You'd better take this. Careful now, it's coming back. Uh, not bad,
Potter! You'd make a fair Beater. Uh-oh.

WOOD: Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you... are a Seeker. The only thing
I want you to worry about is this, the Golden Snitch.

could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found
me... I'd probably be dead.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to
do. I would have expected more rational behavior on your part and I am very
disappointed in you Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor
for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen, well, I just
hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many first year students could
take on a fully-grown mountain troll, and live to tell the tale! Five

against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you. Even
if it is against Slytherin.
HARRY: That explains the blood.

HARRY: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as diversion
so he could try and get past that three-headed dog. But, he got himself
bitten. That's why he's limping.

HARRY: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the
vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business, very secret.

HAGRID: Snape? Blimey, you're not still on abou' him, are you?
HARRY: Hagrid! We know he's after the Stone, we just don't know why!
HAGRID: Snape is one of the teachers protectin' the Stone! He's not abou' to
steal it.
HARRY: What?
HAGRID: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.
HARRY: Wait a minute! `One of the teachers?'
HERMIONE: Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't
there? Spells, enchantments?
HAGRID: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me. Ain't no one gonna
get past Fluffy. Heh, heh... Ain't a soul knows how, `cept fer me and
Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I should not have told you that.
Ooh, ooh... Ow... Oooh... Ooh, ooh...
HARRY: Hagrid, what exactly is that?
HAGRID: That? It's ah... it's um...
RON: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?
HAGRID: I won it! Off a stranger I met down at the pub. Seemed quite glad to
be rid of it, as a matter o' fact.
HERMIONE: Is that... a dragon?
RON: That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother
Charlie works with these in Romania.
HAGRID: Isn't he beau'iful? Oh, bless him. Look, he knows his mummy! Hello,
Norbert!
HARRY: Norbert?

HAGRID: Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don' he? Don't you, Norbert? Te
de de de de! Oh! Woah! Oooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! He'll have to be trained up
a bit, of course. Who's that?
HARRY: Malfoy!
HAGRID: Oh, dear.
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ grounds - night
HARRY: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I ever met
him.
RON: It's crazy! And worse, Malfoy knows.
HERMIONE: I don't understand. Is that bad?
RON: It's bad.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Good evening.

LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ Transfiguration classroom - night
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Nothing, I repeat nothing, gives a student the right to
walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
fifty points will be taken.
HARRY: Fifty!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four
of you will receive detention.
DRACO: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said,
`the four of us.'
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see,
honorable as your intentions were, you, too, were out of bed after hours. You
will join you classmates in detention.

FILCH: A pity they let the old punishments go, eh? There was a time detention
would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I'll miss the
screaming. You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little
job to do...inside the Dark Forest. A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. Oh, good God,
man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are ya?
HAGRID: Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a
colony.
HERMIONE: Well, that's good isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
HAGRID: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? What if the other dragons
are mean to `im? He's only a baby, after all.
FILCH: Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the
Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about ya...
DRACO: The Forest? I thought that was a joke. We can't go in there. Students
aren't allowed. And there are... werewolves!
FILCH: Ah, there's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure
of that. Nighty-night.
HAGRID: Right. Let's go.
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts - Dark Forest - night
HARRY: Hagrid, what is that?
HAGRID: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn blood, that is. I found
one dead, a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been hurt bad by somethin'. So,
it's our job to go and find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with
me...
RON: Okay...
HAGRID: And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.
DRACO: Okay, then I get Fang!

HAGRID: Fine. Jus' so`s you know, he's a bloody coward.
DRACO: You wait till my father hears about this! This is servant stuff.
HARRY: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
DRACO: Scared, Potter? Did you hear that?
HARRY: Come on, Fang!
DRACO: Scared!
FANG: Grrrr...
HARRY: What is it, Fang?
DRACO: Ahhhhh! Ah! Ah! ...Ahhh! Ahh!
FIRENZE: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here.
The Forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
HARRY: But, what was that thing you saved me from?
FIRENZE: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch
from death, but at a terrible price. For you have slain something so pure,
that from the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life,
a cursed life.
HARRY: But, who would choose such a life?
FIRENZE: Can you think of no one?
HARRY: You mean to say, that that thing that killed the unicorn, that was
drinking its blood, that was Voldemort?
FIRENZE: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Mr.
Potter?
HARRY: The Sorcerer's Stone!
FANG: Ruff! Ruff!
HERMIONE: Harry!
HAGRID: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all
right there, Harry?
FIRENZE: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.

HERMIONE: You mean, You-Know-Who is out there, right now, in the Forest?
HARRY: But he's weak. He's living off of unicorns. Don't you see? We had it
wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for
Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll...
he'll come back.
RON: But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?
HARRY: I think if he'd had his chance he might have tried to kill me tonight.
RON: (Gulp) And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final.
HERMIONE: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry,
you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched.

HERMIONE: I'd always heard Hogwart's end-of-year exams were frightful, but
I've found they're rather enjoyable.
RON: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?
HARRY: My scar. It keeps burning.
HERMIONE: It's happened before...
HARRY: Not like this.
RON: Perhaps you should see the nurse.
HARRY: I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. Ah... Oh! Of course!
HERMIONE: What is it?
HARRY: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than
anything is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I

mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why
didn't I see it before?
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ Hagrid's Hut - exterior - daytime
HARRY: Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? What did he look like?
HAGRID: I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
HARRY: This stranger though, you and he must have talked.
HAGRID: Well, he- he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I
told him, I said, after Fluffy a dragon's gonna be no problem.
HARRY: Did he seem interested in Fluffy?
HAGRID: Well, o' course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come
across a three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told `im, I
said, I said, `The trick with any beast is to know how to calm `im. Take
Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit o' music, and he falls straight to
sleep.' I shouldn't have told you that. Where are you going? Where are you-?
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ Transfiguration classroom - daytime
HARRY: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He
received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for
London.
HARRY: He's gone! Now! But, this is important! This is about the Sorcerer's
Stone!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: How do you know-?
HARRY: Someone's going to try to steal it!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I don't know how you three found out about the Stone,
but I assure you it is perfectly well protected. Now, would you go back to
your dormitories, quietly.
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ hallway - daytime
HARRY: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which
means, he knows how to get past Fluffy.
HERMIONE: And with Dumbledore gone-
SNAPE: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors, such as
yourselves, be doing inside on a day like this?
HERMIONE: Ah, w- w- w... we- we were just-
SNAPE: You ought to be careful. People will think you're... up to something.

I- I'll fight you!
HERMIONE: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this. Petrificus Totalus!

RON: What?
HARRY: Come on! Okay, push! I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a

HERMIONE: I remember reading something in Herbology.
RON: Help!

HARRY: I don't know. Strange...
RON: Alohomora! Well, it was worth a try.
HERMIONE: Urrgh! What are we going to do? There must be a thousand keys up
there!
RON: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty, like the
handle.
HARRY: There! I see it! The one with the broken wing!
HERMIONE: What's wrong, Harry?
HARRY: It's too simple.

You're the youngest Seeker in a century! This complicates things a bit!

queen-side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight.
HERMIONE: What happens now?
RON: Well, white moves first, and then... we play.
HERMIONE: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like... real wizard's

HERMIONE: No, you can't! There must be another way!

you that has to go on. I know it! Not me. Not Hermione. You! Knight to H-3.
Check. Ahh!
HERMIONE: Ron!
HARRY: No! Don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing! Checkmate! Take
care of Ron, then go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's
right. I have to go on.

PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Why next to him,
who would suspect "p- p- poor st- st- stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
HARRY: But- but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: No, dear boy, I tried to kill you! And trust me, if
Snape's cloak hadn't caught on fire and broken my eye contact, I would have
succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.
HARRY: Snape was trying to save me?
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: I knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.
HARRY: Then- then you let the troll in!
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't
fooled. When everyone else was running about the dungeon, Snape went to the
third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely
left me alone. But, he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now, what
does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the Stone.
But, how do I get it?
VOLDEMORT: Use the boy.
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Come here, Potter! Now! Tell me... what do you see? What
is it, what do you see?
HARRY: I- I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I- I've won the House Cup.
VOLDEMORT: He lies.
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Tell the truth! What do you see?
VOLDEMORT: Let me speak to him.
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Master, you are not strong enough!
VOLDEMORT:I have strength enough for thisss. Harry Potter, we meet again.
HARRY: Voldemort?
VOLDEMORT: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive?
Live off another. A mere parasite! Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it
cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something,
that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.

Scene 31: Magic Touch.
VOLDEMORT: Stop him! Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you
can join me... and live?
HARRY: Never!
VOLDEMORT: Ha, ha ha! Bravery. Your parents had it, too. Tell me, Harry,
would you like to see your mother and father again? Together we can bring
them back. All I ask is for something in return. That's it, Harry. There is
no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it.
Together we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone!
HARRY: You liar!
VOLDEMORT: Kill him!
PROFESSOR QUIRRELL: Ahh! Ahh-aaah! What is this magic?
VOLDEMORT: Fool! Get the Stone!

DUMBLEDORE: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor
Quirrell is a complete secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows. Ahh, I
see that your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your
Chocolate Frogs.
HARRY: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
DUMBLEDORE: Fine. They're both just fine.
HARRY: But, what happened to the Stone?
DUMBLEDORE: Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas
and I have had a little chat, and agreed it was best all around.
HARRY: But then, Flamel- he'll die won't he?
DUMBLEDORE: He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he
will die.
HARRY: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute, I was there staring in the
mirror, and then the next-
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, you see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone- find it,
but not use it- would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant
ideas. And, between you and me, that is saying something.
HARRY: Does that mean- with the Stone gone, that is- that Voldemort can never
come back?
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, I'm afraid... there are ways in which he can return. Harry,
do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? It
was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of
act leaves a mark. Oh, no- this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your
very skin.
HARRY: What is it?
DUMBLEDORE: Love, Harry. Love. Ah, Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was
most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since
then, I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But, I think I could be safe
with a nice toffee. Hmm... Alas! Earwax!

hundred and fifty-two points. In second place, Ravenclaw with four hundred
and twenty-six points. And in first place, with four hundred and seventy-two
points, Slytherin House.
SLYTHERINS: Yeah! Yeah!
DRACO: Nice one, mate.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes, yes. Well done, Slytherin. Well done, Slytherin. However,
recent events must be taken into account. And, I have a few last-minute
points to award. To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when
others were in grave peril, fifty points.
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah!

HARRY: Good job!
DUMBLEDORE: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess
that Hogwarts has seen these many years, fifty points.
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah!
DUMBLEDORE: And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding
courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah! Yeah!
HERMIONE: We're tied with Slytherin!
DUMBLEDORE: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your
enemies. But, a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten
points to Neville Longbottom.
GRYFFINDORS: Yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
DUMBLEDORE: Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of
decoration is in order. Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
