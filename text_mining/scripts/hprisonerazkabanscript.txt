AUNT PETUNIA: Marge! Lovely to see you- How was the train?
HARRY: Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form.
UNCLE VERNON: What is it?
HARRY: Nothing. School stuff.
UNCLE VERNON: Later perhaps, if you behave.
HARRY: I will if she does.

LOCATION: No. Four Privet Drive ­ Dining room - daytime
AUNT MARGE: Oh- Still here, are you?
HARRY: Yes.
AUNT MARGE: Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful way. Good of my brother to keep
ya. He'd have been straight into an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my
doorstep, Vernon.
DUDLEY: Ah-ha-ha-ha... Ah-ha!

UNCLE VERNON: Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
HARRY: Okay.

AUNT MARGE: Now, finish that off for mummy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
UNCLE VERNON: Can I tempt you, Marge?
AUNT MARGE: Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. Heh- eh, a bit more.
Usually it's just a fry-up for me, what with twelve dogs. A bit more... That's a
boy. Umm. Aah. You want to try a little drop of brandy? A little bit `o brundy-
brandy-wundy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?... What are you smirking at?
HARRY: (shrug)
AUNT MARGE: Where is it you send the boy, Vernon?
UNCLE VERNON: St. Brutus's. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
AUNT MARGE: Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?
HARRY: Oh, yeah. Yeah- I've, I've been beaten loads of times. Umm.
AUNT MARGE: Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it. Heh- But you mustn't blame yourself about how
this one's turned out, Vernon. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
AUNT PETUNIA: Nothing. Uh, he did... he didn't work. He was- was- unemployed.
AUNT MARGE: And a drunk, too, no doubt-
HARRY: That's a lie.
AUNT MARGE: What did you say?
HARRY: My dad wasn't a drunk.

AUNT PETUNIA: Oh!
AUNT MARGE: Oh, huh-ha! Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm
grip.
UNCLE VERNON: I think it's time you went to bed.
AUNT MARGE: Quiet, Vernon. You- clean it up! Actually, it's nothing to do with
the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs.
If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the
pup...
HARRY: Shut up! Shut up!
AUNT MARGE: Umm. Right. Let me tell you... y- ye...
UNCLE VERNON: Ohm... umm...
AUNT MARGE: Ah! Ahh! Vernon! Vernon, Vernon, do something!
UNCLE VERNON: Ow! Ripper! Owww! R- Ripper, get down boy! Get down!

you've ne'er been hearin' o' Sirius Black? He's a murderer. Got 'imself locked
up in Azkaban for it.
HARRY: How did he escape?
STAN SHUNPIKE: Well, tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' one that done
it. He was a big supporter of... You-Know-'Oo. Reckon you heard of him?
HARRY: Yeah. Him I've heard of.
SHRUNKEN HEAD: Ernie, two double-deckers at twelve o'clock. They're getting

HARRY: Hedwig!
TOM: Right smart bird you've got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five
minutes before yourself.
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Eh-hem... As the Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform
you, Mr. Potter, that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a
little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic
Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident
whatsoever. So, that's that... and no harm done. Pea soup?
HARRY: Uh- no thank you. Um, Minister...
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Yes?
HARRY: I don't understand.
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Understand?
HARRY: I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home --

CORNELIUS FUDGE: Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to
Azkaban for blowing up their aunts!
TOM: Huh, huh, huh, huh!
CORNELIUS FUDGE: On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of
things, was very, very irresponsible.
HARRY: 'The state of things' sir?
CORNELIUS FUDGE: We have a killer on the loose.
HARRY: Sirius Black, you mean? But, what's he got to do with me?
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Uh-hmm? Oh, nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what
matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. Oh- ah, these are
your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them brought here for you.
Now, Tom will show you to your room.
HARRY: Hedwig.
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here it would be best if
you didn't, ah... wander.

Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
HERMIONE: He's a cat, Ronald! What do you expect? It's in his nature.
RON: A cat! Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair, if you
ask me.
HERMIONE: That's rich, coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
It's all right, Crookshanks. You just ignore the mean little boy...

HARRY: Yeah, sure.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Hermione!
HERMIONE: Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Looking forward to a new term?
HARRY: Yeah, it should be great.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Harry, there are some within the Ministry who would strongly
discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But, I think that
you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger.
HARRY: Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
ARTHUR WEASLEY: What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
HARRY: Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Do you know why? Harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
HARRY: Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Don't say his name.
HARRY: Sorry.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: ...when you stopped You-Know-Who, Black lost everything. But, to
this day he still remains a faithful servant. And, in his mind, you are the only
thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why
he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you.
HARRY: And kill me.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Harry. I want you to swear to me that whatever you might hear --
you won't go looking for Black.
HARRY: Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?

RON: Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come
after you?
HARRY: Yeah.
HERMIONE: But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean- everyone's looking for
him.
RON: Sure... except, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before, and he's a
murderous, raving lunatic.
HARRY: Thanks, Ron.
HERMIONE: Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet...
RON: What's going on?
HARRY: Dunno... maybe we've broken down.
HERMIONE: Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!
RON: There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard.

HARRY: Thank you.
LUPIN: Here, eat this. It'll help. It's alright, it's chocolate.
HARRY: Wh- what was that thing... that came?
LUPIN: It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was
searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a
little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better.
HARRY: What happened to me?
RON: Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or
something.
HARRY: And... and did either of you two? You know... pass out?
RON: No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again.
HARRY: But someone was screaming. A woman.
HERMIONE: No one was screaming, Harry.

Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and
cauldron bubble. Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble!
Something wicked this way comes!
DUMBLEDORE: Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a
few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm
pleased to welcome Professor R. J. Lupin, who's kindly consented to fill the
post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor!
ALL: (applause)
HERMIONE: Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
DRACO: Potter... Potter! Is it true you fainted?
OTHER: Ohhhh!
DRACO: I mean, you actually fainted?
RON: Shove off, Malfoy.
HARRY: How did he find out?
HERMIONE: Just forget it.

DUMBLEDORE: As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more
time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his
place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid!
ALL: (Applause)
HERMIONE: Whoo-hoo!
DUMBLEDORE: Finally, on a more disquieting note, at the request of the Ministry
of Magic, Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of
Azkaban, until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be
stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now, whilst I've been assured that
their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution.
dementors are vicious creatures. They will not distinguish between the one they
hunt, and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every
one of you to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a
dementor to be forgiving. But, you know, happiness can be found even in the
darkest of times... if only one remembers to turn on the light.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the
noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess... `the
Sight'! Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together, we shall cast ourselves into
the future. This term we shall be focusing on Tasseomancy, which is the art of
reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite
you... What do you see? The truth lies buried, like a sentence deep within a
book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you
must look... beyond!
HERMIONE: What a load of rubbish.
RON: Where did you come from?
HERMIONE: Me? I've been here all this time.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: You, boy! Is your grandmother quite well?
NEVILLE: Ah... I- I think so.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Oh, umm.
Pity. Broaden your minds. Hmmm. Woah! Your aura is pulsing, dear! Are you in the
beyond? I think you are!
RON: Sure.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
RON: Oh, yeah, um, well, Harry's got a sort of a wonky cross- that's trials and
suffering- and, uh, that there could be the sun- and that's happiness- so, ah,
you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Give me the cup. Oh- aah! Oh, dear boy. My dear...you have
the Grim!
SEAMUS: The Grin? What's the Grin?
BEM: Not the grin, you idiot. The Grim. `Taking the form of a giant spectral
dog, it's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen of death.'

RON: You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black, do
you?
HERMIONE: Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly
discipline. Now, Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject.
RON: Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
HERMIONE: A fair few.
RON: Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as
Divination. You'd have to be in two classes at once!
HERMIONE: Don't be silly, Ronald. How could anyone be in two classes at once?

is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to
insult a hippogriff. It may just be the las' thing yeh ever do. Now, who'd like

HAGRID: Well done, Harry! Well done. Come on, now. Now, you have to let 'im make

wait and see if he bows back. And if he does, you can go and touch him. If not-

particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so --
LUPIN: -so terrifying, yes, yes, yes. Luckily, a very simple charm exists to
repel a Boggart. Let's practice it now. Ah, without wands, please... after me...
Riddikulus!
STUDENTS: Riddikulus!
LUPIN: Very good. A little louder, and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus!
STUDENTS: Riddikulus!
DRACO: This class is ridiculous.
LUPIN: Very good- well, so much for the easy part. You see, the incantation
alone is not enough. What really finishes a Boggart is... laughter. You need to
force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Ah- Neville,
would you join me, please? Come on. Don't be shy, come on. Come on.
LUPIN: Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?
NEVILLE: Profter... S- Snafpt...

LUPIN: Sorry-
NEVILLE: Professor Snape.
LUPIN: Professor Snape. Yes, frightens us all. And I believe you live with your
grandmother?
NEVILLE: Yes, but I don't want that Boggart to turn into her, either.
LUPIN: No...It won't. I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes, very
clearly in your mind.
NEVILLE: She carries a red handbag...
LUPIN: We don't need to hear it. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when
I open that wardrobe, here's what I want you to do... Excuse me...
(whispers)Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
LUPIN: Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three. Think, Neville.
Think!
NEVILLE: Riddikulus!
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
LUPIN: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay! To
the back, Neville. Everyone form a line. Form a line. I want everyone to picture
the thing they fear the very most, and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron!
Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!
RON: Ooh..
LUPIN: Wand at the ready, Ron. Wand at the ready!
RON: Riddikulus!
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha!
LUPIN: Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely very, very
enjoyable! Parvati, next! Step up. Show us what you see. Keep your nerve.
Steady...
PARVATI: Riddikulus!
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha!
LUPIN: And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful. Heeere! Riddikulus!
Right, well, sorry about that. Ah, that's enough for today. If you'd all like to
collect your books from the back of the class, that's the end of the lesson.
Thank you... Sorry, sorry, you've already had too much of a good thing.

privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting
the Village. That's the rule, Potter.
FILCH: Those with permission follow me. Those without, stay put.
HARRY: But Professor, I thought if you signed it, then I could go-
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I can't. Only a parent or guardian can sign. Since I am

HARRY: Professor, can I ask you something?
LUPIN: You want to know why I stopped you facing that Boggart, yes? I would've
thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
HARRY: I did think of Voldemort... at first. But then, I remembered that night
on the train... and the dementor...
LUPIN: Well, I'm very impressed. That suggests that what you fear the most is
fear itself. This is very wise.
HARRY: Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming.
LUPIN: Well, dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain
becomes their power.

HARRY: I think it was my mother. The night she was murdered.
LUPIN: You know, the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you
immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother Lily's. Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else
was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch, she was also an uncommonly kind
woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others, even -- and perhaps, most
especially... when that person couldn't see it in themselves... And your father,
James, on the other hand, he ah, heh- He had a certain, shall we say, talent for
trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than
you know, Harry. In time you'll come to see just how much.

SNAPE: Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own,
completely undetected...
DUMBLEDORE: Quite remarkable, yes.
SNAPE: Any theories about how he might have managed it?
DUMBLEDORE: Many, each as unlikely as the next.
SNAPE: You may recall that prior to the start of term, I did express concerns
about your appointment of Professor-
DUMBLEDORE: Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black
enter it. No, I'm quite convinced the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing
to send the students back to their Houses.
SNAPE: What about Potter? Should he be warned?

RON: When did she come in? Did you see her come in?
SNAPE: Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a
werewolf?
SNAPE: No one? How disappointing.
HERMIONE: Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an
animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon when he transforms he no
longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path.
Furthermore, the werewolf only responds only to the call of its own kind ­
DRACO: Owooo!
SNAPE: Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That is the second time you have spoken out of
turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself, or do you take
pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
RON: He's got a point, you know.
SNAPE: Five points from Gryffindor! As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my
desk by Monday morning, two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with particular
emphasis on recognizing it.

earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is
left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry.
The dementors affect you, most of all, because there are true horrors in your
past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be
ashamed of.
HARRY: I'm scared, Professor.
LUPIN: Well, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
HARRY: I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that
dementor on the train go away...
LUPIN: There was only one that night...

Patronus is a kind of positive force, and for the wizard who can conjure one, it

works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need think of a memory. And not just any
memory, a very happy memory. A very powerful memory. Can you do this? Yes. Very
well. Close your eyes... concentrate... explore your past... Do you have a
memory? Allow it to fill you up... Lose yourself within it... Then speak the

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Broaden your minds... You must look beyond... The art of
crystal-gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then, can you see. Try
again. Now, what do we have here...?
RON: (snoring)...Huh?
HERMIONE: Oh, ah- do you mind me trying?
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Ah!
HERMIONE: The Grim. Possibly.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my
class, I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of
Divination. No, you see, there. Ah, you may be young in years, but the heart
that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry
as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
OTHER: What's happened? I can't believe it!
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Have I said something?

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY (channeling): Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose
heart rots with murder, shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt, and
servant and Master shall be reunited once more... ah, ach...
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY: Oh- I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?
HARRY: No. Nothing.

SIRIUS: No. Only one will die tonight.
HARRY: Then it'll be you!
SIRIUS: Ha, Ha! Ha, ha, ha! Are you going to kill me, Harry?
LUPIN: Expelliarmus!
HARRY, HERMIONE, RON: Professor Lupin!
LUPIN: Well, well, Sirius, looking a bit ragged, aren't we? Finally the flesh
reflects the madness within.
SIRIUS: Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?
SIRIUS: I found him!
LUPIN: I know.
SIRIUS: It's him!
LUPIN: I understand.
SIRIUS: Let's kill him!
HERMIONE: No! I trusted you! And all this time you've been his friend! He's a
werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes!
LUPIN: How long have you known?
HERMIONE: Since Professor Snape set the essay.
LUPIN: Well, well, well, Hermione, you really are the brightest witch of your
age I've ever met.
SIRIUS: Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!
LUPIN: Wait--
SIRIUS: I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!
LUPIN: Very well. Kill him! But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to
know why.
HARRY: I know why. You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead.
LUPIN: No, Harry, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents, but it was
somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead.
HARRY: Who was it then?
SIRIUS: Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out,
Peter. Come out, come out and play...
SNAPE: Expelliarmus! Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch
you.
LUPIN: Severus-
SNAPE: I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And
now, here's the proof.
SIRIUS: Brilliant, Snape! Once again you've put your keen and penetrating mind
to the task and, as usual, come to the wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse
us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to.
SNAPE: Give me a reason. I beg you!

LUPIN: Severus, don't be a fool!
SIRIUS: He can't help it. It's habit by now.
LUPIN: Sirius, be quiet!
SIRIUS: Be quiet, yourself, Remus!
SNAPE: Listen to you two. Quarreling like an old married couple.
SIRIUS: Why don't you just run along and play with your chemistry set?
SNAPE: I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing
to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A dementor's kiss. One can
only imagine what that must be like to endure. It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.
LUPIN: Severus, please-
SNAPE: After you.
HARRY: Expelliarmus!

Scene 25: Peter Petigrew.
RON: Harry. What did you just do?
HERMIONE: You attacked a teacher!
HARRY: Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
LUPIN: He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend.
HARRY: No. Pettigrew's dead. He killed him!
LUPIN: No he didn't! I thought so, too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on
the Map!
HARRY: The Map was lying then-
SIRIUS: The Map never lies! Pettigrew's alive, and he's right there!
RON: M- me? He's mental!
SIRIUS: Not you, y-. Your rat!
RON: Scabbers has been in my family for ye-
SIRIUS: Twelve years. A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's
missing a toe, isn't he?
RON: So what?
HARRY: All they could find of Pettigrew was his-
SIRIUS: -finger! The dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was
dead. And then he transformed into a rat.
HARRY: Show me. Give it to him, Ron.
RON: What are you going to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing? Scabbers!
PETTIGREW: Aaaah! R- Remus... S- Sirius...  My old friends! H- Harry! Look at
you! Y- you look just like your father. Like James. We were the best of friends,
he and I-
SIRIUS: How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of
him!
LUPIN: You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?!
PETTIGREW: I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he
possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius, what you would have done? What would you have
done?
SIRIUS: I would have died! I would have died rather than betray my friends!
PETTIGREW: Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad- Your dad would
have spared me! He would have shown me mercy!
LUPIN: You should have realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then
we would. Together!
HARRY: No!
LUPIN: Harry, this man is...
HARRY: I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
PETTIGREW: Bless you, boy! Bless you-
HARRY: Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors
can have you.

SIRIUS: Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.
RON: A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
SIRIUS: Well, I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition
as a dog. In fact, more than once James suggested that I make the change
permanent. The tail I could live with, but the fleas, they're murder.

HERMIONE: Ah- that looks really painful.

noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it.

HARRY: You mean they're going to kill him?
HERMIONE: No. It's worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster! You've
got to stop them! They've got the wrong man!
HARRY: It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent-
RON: It's Scabbers who did it!
DUMBLEDORE: Scabbers...?
RON: He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. He was my
brother Percy's rat-- but then they gave him an owl, and I got-
HERMIONE: The point is... we know the truth. Please, believe us.
DUMBLEDORE: I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen
year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and
true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
(bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong)
DUMBLEDORE: A mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with...
dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the
laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to
return before this last chime. If not... the consequences are too ghastly to
discuss. If you succeed tonight, more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, by the way, when in doubt, I find
retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.

----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ hallway - night
SIRIUS: I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.
HARRY: I want to go with you.
SIRIUS: One day, perhaps. For some time my life will be too unpredictable. And
besides, you're meant to be here.
HARRY: But, you're innocent.
SIRIUS: And you know it. And for now, that'll do.
HERMIONE: Down, Buckbeak.
SIRIUS: I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your
father. Except your eyes... you have-
HARRY: My mother's eyes.
SIRIUS: It's cruel that I got to spend so much time with James and Lily, and you
so little... But know this- the ones that love us never really leave us, and you
can always find them... in here.
SIRIUS: You really are the brightest witch of your age.
(bong, bong, bong)
HERMIONE: We have to go.

LUPIN: Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me.
HARRY: You've been sacked.
LUPIN: No. No, I resigned, actually.
HARRY: Resigned? Why?
LUPIN: Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This
time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want a, ah-
well, someone like me teaching their children.
HARRY: But Dumbledore-
LUPIN: Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like
me are,... well... let's just say that I'm used to it by now. Why do you look so
miserable, Harry?
HARRY: None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.
LUPIN: Didn't make any difference? Harry, it made all the difference in the
world. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible
fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything, it is of
how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher, I
feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now, I'll say good-
bye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief
managed.
