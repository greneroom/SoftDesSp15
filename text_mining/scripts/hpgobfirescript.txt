LORD VOLDEMORT: How fastidious you've become, Wormtail. As I recall,
you once called the newest scuttlebutt hope. Could it be that your
boundless mercy is but unwillingness from you?
WORMTAIL: Oh, no, no, no, my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if
we were to do it without the boy-
VOLDEMORT: No! The boy is everything. It cannot be done without him,
and it will be done exactly as I say.
BARTY CROUCH JUNIOR: I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
VOLDEMORT: Good! First, gather our old comrades. Send them a- a sign.
NAGINI: Hay-sha-gasa-asay. Sa--say ah a-say.
VOLDEMORT: Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker is standing just

it? Isn't there any security or-

happened right under their noses.

DUMBLEDORE: Well, now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make
an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year, but
home to some very special guests, as well. You see, Hogwarts has been
chosen... (whispering) what is it?
FILCH: (whispering) ...Beauxbatons...
DUMBLEDORE: (whispering) They have to wait.
DUMBLEDORE: So, Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event: the
Triwizard Tournament. Now, for those of you who do not know, the
Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools for a series of
magical contests. From each school, a single student is selected to
compete. Now let me be clear: if chosen, you stand alone. And trust me
when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of
that later. For now, please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of
the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and their Headmistress, Madame Maxime.
BEAUXBATONS STUDENTS: Ahh...Ahhh...
RON: Bloody hell...
SEAMUS: Blimey, that's one big woman.
HOGWARTS STUDENTS: Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-oo!
DUMBLEDORE: And now, our friends from the north. Please greet the proud
sons of Durmstrang and their High Master, Igor Karkaroff.
DURMSTRANG STUDENTS: Ho! Ha!... Ho! Ha!

DUMBLEDORE: Not to worry, Madame Maxime. Our gamekeeper, Hagrid, is
more than capable of seeing to them.

PROFESSOR FLITWICK: Ahh! Ha! You idiot!
HAGRID: Ooh.

LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ Great Hall - later
DUMBLEDORE: Your attention, please! I would like to say a few words.
Eternal glory. That is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard
Tournament. But to do this, that student must survive three tasks.
Three extremely dangerous tasks.
FRED AND GEORGE: Wicked.
DUMBLEDORE: For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit to impose a new
rule. To explain all this we have the head of the Department of
International Magical Cooperation, Mr. Bartemius Crouch.
STUDENTS: Ahh! Eeeh!
RON: Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.
HERMIONE: Alastor Moody? The Auror?
DEAN THOMAS: Auror?
RON: Dark wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full, thanks to
him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, these days.
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, my dear old friend, thanks for coming.
MAD-EYE MOODY: Stupid ceiling.
DUMBLEDORE: Ha, ha.
SEAMUS: What's that he's drinkin', do you suppose?
HARRY: I dunno, but I don't think it's pumpkin juice.
MR. CROUCH: After due consideration, the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety, no student under the age of seventeen should be
allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament. This
decision is final.
FRED AND GEORGE: That's rubbish!
GEORGE: That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
OTHERS: Booo!
DUMBLEDORE: Silence!
HERMIONE: We'll not talk about that, then.
DUMBLEDORE: The Goblet of Fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for
the Tournament, merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and
throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so
lightly; if chosen there's no turning back. As from this moment, the
Triwizard Tournament has begun.

LOCATION: Hogwarts - DADA Classroom
MAD-EYE MOODY: Alastor Moody. Ex-Auror. Ministry malcontent. And your
new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I am here because Dumbledore
asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes
to the Dark Arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which
of you can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are?
HERMIONE: Three, sir.
MAD-EYE MOODY: And they are so named?

HERMIONE: Because they are unforgivable. Use any one of them will...
MAD-EYE MOODY: Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now
the Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say
different! You need to know what you're up against! You need to be
prepared! You need to find another place to put your chewing gum
besides the underside of your desk, Mr. Finnigan!
SEAMUS: Aw, no way! The old codger can see out the back of his head!
MAD-EYE MOODY: I'm here to call the class rules! So, which curse shall
we see first? Weasley!
RON: Yes...
MAD-EYE MOODY: Stand! Give us a curse.
RON: Well, my- my dad did tell me about one...
MAD-EYE MOODY: Huh?
RON: The Imperious Curse.
MAD-EYE MOODY: Oh yeah, your father would know all about that. Gave the
Ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show
you why. Hello. Lovely little beauty. Engorgio. Imperio!
STUDENTS: Ha, ha, ha, ha!
CRABBE: Ahh! Ah!
MAD-EYE MOODY: Don't worry. It's completely harmless.
PAVARTI: Oh!
MAD-EYE MOODY: But, if she bites...
RON: Ah! Ahh!
MAD-EYE MOODY: ...she's lethal!
RON: Ah!
STUDENTS: Ha, ha, ha!
DRACO: Ha, Ha! Ha, ha, ha!
MAD-EYE MOODY: What are you laughing at?
DRACO: Ahh! Get it off me!
HARRY: Aha, ha, ha!
MAD-EYE MOODY: Ah-ha, ha, ha! Talented, isn't she? What shall I have
her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself? Scores of witches and
wizards have claimed that they only did You-Know-Whose bidding under
the influence of the Imperious Curse. But, here's the rub: how do we
sort out the liars? Another... another... Ah, ha... come on.
Longbottom, is it? Up. Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude
for Herbology.
NEVILLE: There- there's the um... The Cruciatus Curse.
MAD-EYE MOODY: Correct! Correct! Come, come. Particularly nasty. The
torture curse. Crucio!
HERMIONE: Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him? Stop it!
MAD-EYE MOODY: Ah. Um, huh. Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.
MAD-EYE MOODY: No? Avada Kedavra! The killing curse. Only one person is
known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room.

RON: Brilliant, isn't he! Completely demented, of course. Terrifying to
be in the same room with. But he's really been there, you know. He's
looked evil in the eye.
HERMIONE: There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to
perform them in a classroom... I mean, did you see Neville's face?
HERMIONE: Neville?

FRED: Oh, yeah?
GEORGE: And why's that, Granger?
HERMIONE: You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it
himself.
FRED: So?
HERMIONE: So, a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by a
dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an aging potion.
FRED: Ah, but that's why it's so brilliant.

DUMBLEDORE: The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.
DUMBLEDORE: Excellent! We now have our three champions! But in the end,
only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of

DUMBLEDORE: Harry! Did you put your name in that Goblet of Fire?
HARRY: No, sir.
DUMBLEDORE: Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
HARRY: No, sir.
DUMBLEDORE: You're absolutely sure?
HARRY: Yes, sir. Yes, sir!
MADAME MAXIME: But of course, he is lying.
MAD-EYE MOODY: The hell he is. The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus charm
could have hoodwinked it - magic way beyond the talents of a Fourth
Year!
KARKAROFF: You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.
MAD-EYE MOODY: It was once my job to think as Dark wizards do,
Karkaroff. Perhaps you remember?
DUMBLEDORE: That doesn't help, Alastor. I leave this to you, Barty.
MR. CROUCH: The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a
binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of
tonight, a Triwizard champion.

since when did you accommodate the Ministry?
SNAPE: Master, I, too, find it difficult to believe this mere
coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these
events, perhaps we should, for the time being, let them unfold.

DUMBLEDORE: I agree... with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry,

RITA SKEETER: ...about to compete against three students, not only
vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but who have mastered
spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?
HARRY: Um, I- I dunno. I haven't really...thought about it.
RITA SKEETER: Just ignore the Quill. But then of course, you're no
ordinary boy of twelve, are you?
HARRY: Fourteen.
RITA SKEETER: The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of
your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?
HARRY: Ah, no, I- I didn't enter.
RITA SKEETER: Ah- Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. Ah,
ha. Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how
do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows,
at best, a pathological need for attention; at worst, a psychotic death
wish?

SIRIUS (IN FIRE): Psst...psst. Ahh...
HARRY: Sirius?! How...
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): I don't have much time, Harry, so let me get straight
to it. Did you, or did you not, put your name into the Goblet of Fire?
HARRY: No!
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of
yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man
in the room?
HARRY: I dunno.
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): You didn't hear a name?
HARRY: No. Umm... Voldemort was giving him a job to do, something
important.
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): And what was that?
HARRY: He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to
get to me. Well, I- I mean, it was only a dream, right?
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): Yes. It's just a dream. Look, Harry, the Death Eaters
at the World Cup, your name rising from that Goblet, these are not just
coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more.
HARRY: What are you saying?
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor
Karkaroff, he was a Death Eater. And no one, no one stops being a Death
Eater. Then there's Barty Crouch- heart of stone- sent his own son to
Azkaban.
HARRY: Do you think one of them put my name in the Goblet?
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): I haven't a clue who put your name in that Goblet,
Harry, but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this
tournament.
HARRY: I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
SIRIUS (IN FIRE): You don't have a choice.
HARRY: Someone's coming!

What do you want me to say, again?

you sounded so... exhilarated.

HARRY: Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.

MOANING MYRTLE: He-ha! I'd try putting it in the water, if I were you.
HARRY: Myrtle!
MOANING MYRTLE: Hi! Hi-ya, Harry. Aye. Long time, no see. Ah-ha-ah-ooh-
wooo!
MOANING MYRTLE: I was circling a blocked drain the other day, and could
swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are
you, Harry?
HARRY: Polyjuice potion? Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say `try
putting it in the water'?
MOANING MYRTLE: Wee-ooo-eee...ha-ah. Ohh, that's what he did. The other
boy. Mmmm, the handsome one, Cedric. Well, go on. Open it.
MERPERSON: (singing) Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot
sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover
what we took.

MOANING MYRTLE: A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
HARRY: Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the Black Lake, are there?
MOANING MYRTLE: Ahhh, very good. It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.
Almost all the bubbles were gone... Rrrah! Ha! He, he, he, he, he...Ha,

HARRY: Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your
breath under the water for an hour, Hermione?
HERMIONE: Look, Harry, we- we can do this. The three of us can figure
it out.
MAD-EYE MOODY: I hate to break up the skull session. Professor
McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you, Potter, just
Weasley and Granger.
HERMIONE: But sir, the second task is only hours away and...
MAD-EYE MOODY: Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now, and
could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! ...Longbottom!
MAD-EYE MOODY: Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
NEVILLE: You know, i- if you're interested in plants, you'd be better
with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard i- in
Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees?
HARRY: Neville, no offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now,
if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater
for an hour, then great. But otherwise...

something was stolen from each of our champions; a treasure of sorts.
These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of
the Black Lake. In order to win, each champion need only find their
treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough,
MAD-EYE MOODY: Put that in your mouth.
DUMBLEDORE: (Amplified) ...except for this: they will have but one hour
to do so, and one hour only. After that, they will be on their own. No

MR. CROUCH: Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your
own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony
prove consequential, Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate
release. Until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a
convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms?
KARKAROFF: I do, sir.
MR. CROUCH: What do you wish to present?
KARKAROFF: I have names, sir. Ah- There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.
MR. CROUCH: Mr. Rosier is dead.
KARKAROFF: Dead?
MAD-EYE MOODY: Yeah, he took a piece of me with him though, didn't he?
KARKAROFF: I didn't know.
MR. CROUCH: If that is all the witness has to offer...
KARKAROFF: No! No! No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.
MR. CROUCH: Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?
KARKAROFF: Ya, ya, the same. He passed information to You-Know-Who from
inside the Ministry itself.
MR. CROUCH: Very well, Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime, you
will be returned to Azkaban.
KARKAROFF: No! Wait! Wait, please, please! I have more. What about
Snape, Severus Snape?

DUMBLEDORE: As the counsel is very much aware I have given evidence on
this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater, and prior to Lord
Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today,
he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
KARKAROFF: It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord.
MR. CROUCH: Silence! Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of
consequence, this session is now concluded.
KARKAROFF: Oh, no, no, no, no! I heard about one more.
MR. CROUCH: What's that?
KARKAROFF: The name...
MR. CROUCH: Yes?
KARKAROFF: I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and
by means of the Cruciatus Curse, torture, of the auror Frank Longbottom

DUMBLEDORE: Curiosity's not a sin, Harry, but you should exercise
caution. It's a Pensieve. Very useful if, like me, you find your mind a
wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already
seen. You see, Harry, I've searched and searched for something, some
small detail, something I might have overlooked, something that would
explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close
to an answer, it slips away. It's maddening.

HARRY: Sir, Mr. Crouch's son, what exactly happened to him?
DUMBLEDORE: He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it, but he
had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?
HARRY: It's just that I- I had a dream about him. It was in the summer,
before school. In the dream, I was in a house, and Voldemort was there-
only he wasn't quite human- and Wormtail was there, too, and Mr.
Crouch's son.
DUMBLEDORE: Have there been others like this dream?
HARRY: Yes, always the same one. Sir... these dreams- what I see- you
don't think it's actually happening, do you?
DUMBLEDORE: I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams,
Harry. I think it's best that you simply... cast them away.

spill his darkest secrets. The use of it on a student is, regrettably,
forbidden. However, should you ever steal from my personal stores
again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
HARRY: I haven't stolen anything.

fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night
thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was
love. You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only
son, she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch him. It

Fire. You bewitched Krum. But...

You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.

does not wish me to tell you this. But, not to do so, I think, would be
an insult to his memory. Now, the pain we all feel at this dreadful
loss reminds me, and reminds us, that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light
of recent events, the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be
more important than ever. Remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not
have died in vain. You remember that, and we'll celebrate a boy who was
kind, and honest, and brave, and true, right to the very end.

LOCATION: Hogwarts ­ Gryffindor boys' dormitory - daytime
DUMBLEDORE: Huh... I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my
fourth year; by accident, of course. I put you in terrible danger this
year, Harry. I'm sorry.
HARRY: Professor, when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment...
um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
DUMBLEDORE: Priori Incantatem... You saw your parents that night,
didn't you? They reappeared.
DUMBLEDORE: No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know
that. Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the
choice between what is right, and what is easy. But remember this, you
have friends here. You're not alone.
