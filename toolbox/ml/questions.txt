1. The general trend of the curve is that the more data used for training, the more accurate the model is at predicting the test data.

2. The beginning of the curve is noiser, due to randomness in strength of the model based on how "normal" or "abnormal" the number images the model was trained on are.

3. At num_trials = 100, the curve smooths out a bit, at 1000, it is quite smooth.

4. At higher values of C, the model is more accurate, and the curve is smoother.
